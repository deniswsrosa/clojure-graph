# Graph exercise in clojure

   This is my first exercise in clojure, in summary is an example a graph implementation that also provides endpoints to change its internal ponctuation system.

## Usage

	You should  have leiningen installed on your machine in order to run this project.
	After extract the files, run the following commands:
	
	lein deps
	lein test
	lein ring server
	
	
	After some seconds a ring server will be started and your defaul browser open at ttp://localhost:3000/,
	if don't, please open the previous address in a browser.
	
	The home page is self explanatory, you can call all API methods from there.
